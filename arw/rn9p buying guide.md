# How to buy the right model of the Redmi Note 9 Pro
## Preamble
The desired model in this case is `joyeuse`

`joyeuse` has an SM7125 Snapdragon 720G CPU and does **not** support 5G.
## Step 1: Locate potential devices
For this I recommend [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Redmi+Note+9+Pro)
## Step 2: Identify device model
To identify whether the device is a `joyeuse`, `curtana` or `gauguin` we can do three things:
### Thing A:
#### Check the connectivity type
Only `gauguin` devices support 5G. As stated in the preamble, the desired model is `joyeuse`. Ignore any `gauguin` devices you find.
### Thing B:
#### Identify the CPU/SOC
This is an optional step to rule out any remaining `gauguin` devices.
The CPU/SOC (names interchangeable) should be the SM7125/Snapdragon 720G (again, names interchangeable). If it isn't, ignore the device.
### Thing C:
#### Check the back glass colour
Now that we shouldn't have any `gauguin` devices left, we need to identify whether the device is `joyeuse` or `curtana`, this is easiet done with blue-coloured ones.

| This is good. | This is bad. |

Notice how the `curtana` has a black border under the camera bump, that's the main way to identify one of these. Avoid `curtana` devices at all costs.
`joyeuse` on the other hand **does not** have that black border and has a pattern of angled stripes on the lower part of the glass. This is the desired device.

## Step 3:
There is no step 3, preferably send the listing link to Oliver so he can verify that it is in fact a `joyeuse` device
